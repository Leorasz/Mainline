-Speed testing

-Hyperparameter Optimization
-Skip backprop- train a GAN without a repetition
-Feedbackward net
-Variable input/output handling with batches
-Stop checking for certain errors once impossible for them to happen (i.e. you already know A and B's shapes will always be good for matmul from the first run, so you don't check every time)
-Bound weights
-Be able to load an LLM
